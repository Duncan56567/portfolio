            As a novice front-end engineer, I am proficient in fundamental
            skills such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, and SCSS, and develop
            user-friendly and responsive websites with clean and
            easy-to-understand code. I excel in teamwork and communicate
            effectively with people from different perspectives. Additionally, I
            have learned some back-end skills such as NodeJS and database
            control, and hope to become a full-stack engineer in the future.
